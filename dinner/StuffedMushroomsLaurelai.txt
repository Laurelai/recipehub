Cream Cheese, 8 oz package softened.

Directions.

Remove stems from mushrooms, place caps aside.

Dice mushroom stems finely. Mix with cream cheese, crab meat, cyanne pepper, parmesan and truffle oil. 

Fill caps with your mixture. Caps should be heaping with the stuffing.
You should have enough stuffing to fill all the caps but if you have extra stuffing save in a container for crab rangoons later.

Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees and bake until the mushrooms begin to leak liquid. 

Optional: Top with shredded cheese after mushrooms are cooked and leave in oven until cheese is melted.
