Potato and Corn Chowder - Makes 6-8 servings

Ingredients:
-2 Tbsp cooking oil
-Bacon as desired (see bacon instructions)
-1 White or yellow onion, sliced or chopped
-3-4 lbs roughly chopped Yukon Gold potatoes
-2 boxes 64oz chicken broth
-Whipping cream
-1 lb shredded/grated cheddar cheese
-2 Tbsp flour
-12-16oz frozen corn
-Salt and pepper to taste (see tips)

Basic Method:
-Heat the oil in a heavy bottomed pot or dutch oven over medium heat
-Add the onion and cook until translucent and just starting to brown
-Add the potatoes and cook, stirring, until the outer half of each piece looks cooked compared to the inside.
-Add the broth, increase heat and bring to a boil 
-Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook for 20 minutes
-Put the cheese and flour in a bag and shake until the cheese is evenly coated
-Uncover, increase heat to med-low, and stir in the cream until the soup has a good off-white color
-Stir in the cheese
-Let the soup come up to a boil then stir in the frozen corn.

Serve Hot with garlic bread

3 ways to add bacon: 
1 - Bake 8 (or more) strips in the oven at 400 for 15-17 min when the soup is covered then crumble them into the soup after adding the cheese 
2 - Buy prepackaged bacon pieces and add them at the table
3 - Cut up and cook 1/2 lb bacon in the pot before adding the onion and only use enough cooking oil to keep the bacon from sticking too badly.

2 ways to season the soup:
1 - Add salt/pepper/any other seasoning to taste after the cheese. This has the drawback of producing bland potatoes in an otherwise good soup the first night.
2 - Stir in some of the seasoning just before the broth then adjust to taste after the cheese, either adding more seasoning or more cream. This usually gives good results, but it's really easy to end up with overly salty potatoes

Tips:
-This always tastes better the 2nd day
-I use whipping cream, but you can use half and half if you don't mind using a lot more of it.
-The 1st way to add the bacon is my favorite, the 2nd way is easiest, and the 3rd way gets really good flavor but the bacon almost always ends up with a soggy, uncooked texture.
-If you think it's not all going to fit in the pot, you're probably right. Save yourself the clean up and scale down the recipe
-Using a stock pot is easier, but the thiner bottom makes it easy to accidentally burn the potatoes or onion when increasing the heat (or burning everything if you reheat the entire pot later).
