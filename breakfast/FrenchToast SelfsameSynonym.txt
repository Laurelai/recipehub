French Toast - Makes 6-8 slices

Ingredients:
-4 eggs
-2 Tbsp sugar
-1 tsp cinnamon
-1/4 tsp nutmeg
-1/2 tsp vanilla extract
-1/4 cup milk
-4 Tbsp butter (or more if needed)

Method:
-Melt 2 Tbsp of the butter in a pan/skillet over med-low heat
-In a small bowl and using whisk, beat the eggs with sugar until the mix is uniform
-Continue whisking while slowly adding cinnamon and nutmeg to avoid clumps
-Continue whisking to get a little air whipped into the eggs
-While whisking, slowly add vanilla and milk. 
-Keep whipping air into the mix until it's a little frothy.
-Gently pour the egg mix into a shallow pan.
-Once pan is uniformly heated, dip bread slices and fry for a couple minutes on each side, adding butter as you go to keep the pan from drying out.

Serve warm with whatever you like on French toast.

Tips:
-Whipping some air into the egg mixture helps keep the cinnamon and nutmeg from condensing at the top. This makes it so you have the spices on both sides of every slice rather than most of it on the first 1-2 slices and almost nothing on the last 2.
-It's usually better to err on the side of too much butter in the pan. 4 Tbsp should get you 6-8 slices, but if the bread really wants to soak up the butter while cooking you'll need more.
