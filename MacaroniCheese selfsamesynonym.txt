Baked Garlic and Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese (makes 6-8 servings)

Ingredients:
  1 lb macaroni (450 g)
  1/2 stick butter (58 g)
  3 tbsp flour (24 g)
  2 1/2 cups milk 
  1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese (150 g)
  3 cloves crushed garlic
  1/2 cup grated parmesan (50 g)
  Salt and pepper to taste
 
Method:
  -Preheat the oven to 400 F/200 C
  -Cook and drain pasta, set aside
  -In a 10-12" cast iron skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. 
  -When the butter is foamy, whisk in the flour
  -When the butter/flour mixture is light brown, add the milk 1/4 cup at a time, stirring until smooth
  -When all the milk is added, slowly add the shredded cheese and stir until combined
  -When all the cheese is added and the mixture is smooth, mix in salt, pepper, and garlic
  -Remove from heat, stir in the cooked pasta and sprinkle the grated parmesan on top.
  -Bake for 15 minutes or until bubbling and top is browned
  
 Serve Hot
  
 Notes:
  -If you don't have a cast iron skillet, use a saucepan and pour the sauce over the cooked pasta in an oven-safe dish
  -Using penne makes the finished dish look fancier somehow
  -I got very good feedback just using shredded parmesan for the sauce instead of cheddar and not baking it.
  -Changing the kind of cheese can change the consistency of the sauce. Balance this by changing the amount of milk.
  -This also can take a good amount of chilis or chili powder in the sauce.
