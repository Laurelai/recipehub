Chicken Fried Rice - Makes 3-4 servings
This is a variation of what they make at Benihana cobbled together from memory and trial/error with what my family likes.

Ingredients:
-2 Tbsp melted butter
-1 pressed or diced garlic clove
-2 Tbsp cup cooking oil (and more as needed)
-1 large chicken breast
-2 cups cooked and refrigerated rice 
-1/2 white onion, diced
-2 carrots, sliced into thick coins
-2 eggs
-Sesame seeds
-2 Tbsp soy sauce
-Cashews
-Salt and pepper to taste

Method:
-Combine melted butter and garlic, set aside
-Heat 2 Tbsp oil in a large pan/skillet over med-high heat
-Cook the chicken breast for 2 min on each side or until lightly browned
-Pour garlic butter over the chicken, turn breast over once to coat both sides, then set aside
-Reduce heat to medium and cook onion and carrot until soft (add more oil as needed to prevent sticking)
-Scrape the vegetables to the edges of the pan and crack the eggs into the open space in the center
-Scramble the eggs and cook until they're barely done, move the veg mix from the sides to the center and mix with the egg
-Cube the chicken, return to the pan, and cook everything together for a minute or so
-Mix in rice
-Toss sesame seeds over the top and mix, cook until fragrant
-Mix in soy sauce
-Add cashews and cook together for another minute

Serve hot

Tips:
-Using refrigerated the rice prevents it from getting mushy and sticking to the pan.
-The chicken won't be cooked through when you first remove it from the pan but will finish cooking when it's readded. This keeps it from getting overcooked.
-If you want to add other vegetables, add them at a point where there's the right amount of cooking time (eg add green onions early on, add peas or pineapple after the soy sauce).
-Adding too much oil will give you a slimy texture, not enough and it will all stick to the pan.
-Be careful to not add too much soy sauce. The amount in the recipe will seem like it's not enough when you're first adding it in but it is.
